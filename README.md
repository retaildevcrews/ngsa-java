## Run the Application

### Using Visual Studio Codespaces

> Visual Studio Codespaces is the easiest way to evaluate ngsa-java. 

Visual Studio Codespaces is the easiest way to evaluate ngsa. Follow the setup steps in the [Ngsa readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/ngsa) to setup Codespaces.

1. Set up Codespaces from the GitHub repo

2. Input credentials in CosmosUrl and CosmosKey files within secrets folder (Create files if necessary)

3. Run the application

```bash

# run the application
mvn spring-boot:run

```

### Using bash shell

> This will work from a terminal in Visual Studio Codespaces as well

```bash

# environment variables should already be set by running the saveenv.sh script
# He_Name was set during setup and is your Key Vault name
# export AUTH_TYPE=CLI
# export KEYVAULT_NAME=$He_Name

# run the application
mvn spring-boot:run

```

wait for `Netty started on port(s): 4120`

### Testing the application

Open a new bash shell

```bash

# test the application

# test using httpie (installed automatically in Codespaces)
http localhost:4120/version

# test using curl
curl localhost:4120/version

```

Stop ngsa by typing Ctrl-C or the stop button if run via F5
